## 💡 My Process

### 🔧 Built With

- Semantic **HTML5 markup** (`main`, `section`, `figure`, `table`)  
- **CSS Custom Properties** for colors & typography  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- **Flexbox** & **CSS Grid** for layout centering  
- Responsive images using `<figure>`  
- Clean, component-based class structure  
- Google Fonts: **Young Serif** & **Outfit**

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✔ Why `<figure>` is perfect for the recipe image  
Wrapping the main recipe photo inside a `<figure>` gives the image independent semantic meaning.  
It improves accessibility and communicates that the image belongs to the content, not just decoration.

### ✔ Strengthening Semantic HTML

- Proper use of `<section>` for grouped content  
- Using `<table>` for structured nutrition data  
- Maintaining a clear heading hierarchy (`h1 → h2`)  
- Writing descriptive, accessible `alt` text
